# üß† Avantos Journey Builder ‚Äì React Coding Challenge

This project is a solution to the coding challenge provided by Avantos. It simulates a simplified version of their internal system that manages form prefill logic across a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of forms.

The goal is to allow users to view and configure how form fields in downstream forms are prefilled using values from other forms.
